# Advanced Smart Contracts

The Sommelier protocol, like many protocols, is relatively simple in principle but carries many nuances especially as the protocol evolves to newer versions.

This section includes details revolving around the core contracts mentioned in the ["Protocol (V2) Contract Architecture"](../protocol-v2-contract-architecture/) section (and APIs), Fees and Reserves, Cellar Deployment, the use of a CellarRouter, and older versions of the Cellar Architecture (v1.5). The section will be updated with subsections as the project continues to evolve.

# Auction module and participation

Fees received by the protocol are currently held in a module account and in the v7 upgrade will be auctioned for SOMM, with the proceeds being distributed pro rata to stakers of SOMM. The details of how this module works and how to participate in auctions will be provided in the future, shortly before the upgrade containing it.
